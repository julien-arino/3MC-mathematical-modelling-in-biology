# 3MC African Mathematical School on Mathematical Modeling in Biology

These are some of the lectures from the [3MC African Mathematical School on Mathematical Modeling in Biology](https://natural-sciences.nwu.ac.za/paa/3MC-School-BM). To access the code, etc., click the *View on GitHub* button (or [here](https://github.com/julien-arino/3MC-mathematical-modelling-in-biology)) to access the repository content. You can also download the whole repository by clicking the buttons on the left. (You can of course clone the repo, but will have to do it from the GitHub version.)

## [James Watmough](https://jameswatmough.github.io/) (University of New Brunswick)

James' material is on [his website](https://jameswatmough.github.io/). I will add links to stuff he mentions here, for convenience.

- [Lecture 1](https://jameswatmough.github.io/IntroductoryMathematicalBiology/) on the simple death process.
